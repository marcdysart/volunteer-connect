## Volunteer Connect

This software works as a social media network for Guinea Peace Corps Volunteers.  The software allows users to search for posts by other RPCV (Returned Peace Corps Volunteers) who have served from the early sixties to this year.

At somepoint it can be used for PC Volunteers in other countries.
